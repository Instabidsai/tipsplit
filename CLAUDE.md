## Business Brief (Summary)
Build a simple tip calculator and splitter web app called "TipSplit".

What it does:
- User enters the bill total
- User selects tip percentage (15%, 18%, 20%, 25%, or custom)
- User enters number of people splitting
- App instantly shows: tip amount, total with tip, and per-person amount
- Clean, modern UI that works great on mobile (people use this at restaurants on their phone)

Tech stack: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel.
No backend needed — this is 100% client-side.
No authentication, no database, no payments.

Keep it simple. Ship it fast. Make it look professional.
